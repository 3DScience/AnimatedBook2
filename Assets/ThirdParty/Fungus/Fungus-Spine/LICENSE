The Fungus library may be used in any commercial or non-commercial game project. 
In order to keep to the spirit of this open source project, it is expressly forbidden

code or as a compiled library) as part of a commercial library. You are permitted to use 
Fungus for your game projects and integrate it into other free open source libraries, but 
you are not permitted to sell Fungus as a library (e.g. as an asset on the Unity Asset Store).
